## Setting up - 9/27/2021
To setup the project open a terminal/console and follow these steps.
1. At an appropriate location, clone the repo using 
    ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/amayakarl/TimeTrackingSystem.git 
    ```
2. go into the cloned project folder and, use git to move into the dev branch
3. install dependencies using composer
    ```
    $ composer install
    ```    
4. create an .env file for storing your environment variables you can use the existing .env.example file by renaming it to .env or running the below command:   
    ```
    $ cp .env.example .env
    ```
    ***Note**: The command above assumes the use of a bash based terminal.*
5. run the below command to generate a APP_KEY
    ```
    $ php artisan key:generate
    ```
6. make sure you create a database in MySQL, the database name does not matter
7. go back to your cloned folder and make sure that your .env file's DB_* variables are updated according to your database connection settings.   
    example:
    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=time_management_system #same as the database name from step 6.
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```
8. Once your .env file has been updated with the correct database connection settings, run the below command.
    ```
    $ php artisan migrate
    ```
9. To make sure you have default data in your database, run the below command:
    ```
    $ php artisan db:seed
    ```
10. Create a Symbolic link to the storage/app/ folder to save files using the below command.
    ```
    $ php artisan storage:link
    ```
11. Add Google client Id and secret to your .env file. **Message Karl so he provides his one** or follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH6hAW3EqLk) to set up it up your self.
    ```
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<random_numbers>.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<random_security_key>"
    GOOGLE_REDIRECT="http://localhost:8000/authorized" # add this line too
    ```
    ***Note*: never share the key nor the client id with anyone outside the group after being provided by Karl.**

12. To test that you were successful run the below command to start the development server, if an error is thrown let Karl know in the group chat.

    ```
    $ php artisan serve
    ```
13. then open http://localhost:8000/ on your browser
14. If a page shows up telling you to setup the System then you were successful, if instead you see an error message, let Karl know in the group chat.

If you need help setting up, let Karl know via the group chat and have him get into a call to go through the process.
